This is public release 2.0.0 of the Hesiod name service library.
Hesiod can provide general name service for a variety of applications
and is based on the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon (BIND).

To prepare this directory for building, run the command "./configure".
configure takes a number of options; use "./configure --help" to find
out what they are.

Run "make" or "make all" to build the Hesiod library and programs.

Run "make install" to install Hesiod.

You will want to create a configuration file named /etc/hesiod.conf
(/usr/local/etc/hesiod.conf will also work, assuming you used the
default of /usr/local as your install prefix) on your client machines,
reading something like:

	lhs	ns
	rhs	your.domain

If you run named on your client machines, you will need to configure
it to know where to delegate queries of class HS.  Generally, this
configuration information should live in a file named something like
/etc/named.root or /etc/namedb/named.root, which should already exist
and specify the locations of the root name servers for class IN.  You
should add lines which look like:

	; Root HS servers
	.			3600000	HS	NS	server1.your.domain
	server1.your.domain.	3600000	HS	A	XXX.YYY.ZZZ.WWW
	server1.your.domain.	3600000	IN	A	XXX.YYY.ZZZ.WWW
	.			3600000	HS	NS	server2.your.domain
	server2.your.domain.	3600000	HS	A	XXX.YYY.ZZZ.WWW
	server2.your.domain.	3600000	IN	A	XXX.YYY.ZZZ.WWW

To actually create Hesiod information on your central name servers,
you need to make them authoritative for the domain ns.your.domain with
a line in named.boot reading something like:

	primary		ns.your.domain		named.hesiod

And then in named.hesiod, you need data looking something like:

	@	HS	SOA	server.your.domain admin-address.your.domain (
			40000	      ; serial - database version number
			1800	      ; refresh - sec servers
			300	      ; retry - for refresh
			3600          ; expire - unrefreshed data
			7200 )        ; min
		HS	NS	server1.your.domain
		HS	NS	server2.your.domain

	haynes.grplist	HS	TXT	"haynes:2638"
	zephyr.sloc	HS	TXT	"zephyrserver1.my.domain"
	zephyr.sloc	HS	TXT	"zephyrserver2.my.domain"
