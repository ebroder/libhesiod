.TH HESIOD 3 "30 November 1996"
.SH NAME
hesiod_getpwnam, hesiod_getpwuid, hesiod_free_passwd \- Hesiod functions for retrieving passwd information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <hesiod.h>
.PP
.B struct passwd *hesiod_getpwnam(void *\fIcontext\fP, const char *\fIname\fP)
.B struct passwd *hesiod_getpwuid(void *\fIcontext\fP, uid_t \fIuid\fP)
.B void hesiod_free_passwd(void *\fIcontext\fP, struct passwd *\fIpw\fP)
.PP
.B cc file.c \-lhesiod
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This family of functions allows you to retrieve passwd database
information using Hesiod.  To perform lookups, you need an initialized
Hesiod context; see hesiod(3) for details.  You may look up passwd
information by name or by uid; information is returned in the same
format as by
.I getpwnam
or
.IR getpwuid .
It is the caller's responsibility to call
.I hesiod_free_passwd
with the returned passwd entry to free the resources used by the
passwd entry.
.PP
Hesiod queries for passwd information are made using the ``passwd'' or
``uid'' Hesiod type, using either the username or the decimal
representation of the uid as the Hesiod name.  The corresponding
records should be a colon-separated list of fields giving the
username, encrypted password, uid, gid, GECOS information, home
directory, and shell of the user.
.SH RETURN VALUES
On failure,
.I hesiod_getpwnam
and
.I hesiod_getpwuid
return NULL and set the global variable
.I errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
These calls may fail for any of the reasons the routine
.I hesiod_resolve
may fail.
