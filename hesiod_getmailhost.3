.SH NAME
hesiod_getmailhost, hesiod_free_postoffice \- Hesiod functions for retrieving user to postoffice mappings
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <hesiod.h>
.PP
.B struct hesiod_postoffice *hesiod_getmailhost(void *\fIcontext\fP,
.B 	const char *\fIuser\fP)
.B void hesiod_free_postoffice(void *\fIcontext\fP,
.B 	struct hesiod_postoffice *\fIpo\fP)
.PP
.B cc file.c -lhesiod
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This family of functions allows you to retrieve user to postoffice
mappings using Hesiod.  To perform lookups, you need an initialized
Hesiod context; see hesiod(3) for details.  Information is returned in
a
.I hesiod_postoffice
structure, which has the following fields:
.IP hesiod_po_type
The type of postoffice box, typically ``POP''.
.IP hesiod_po_host
The hostname where the postoffice box resides.
.IP hesiod_po_name
The account name on the given postoffice server.
.PP
It is the caller's responsibility to call
.I hesiod_free_postoffice
with the returned postoffice entry to free the resources used by the
postoffice entry.
.PP
Hesiod queries for postoffice information are made using the ``pobox''
Hesiod type, using the username as the Hesiod name.  The corresponding
entries should be space-separated lists of strings giving the type of
postoffice box, the hostname, and the account name.
.SH RETURN VALUES
On failure,
.I hesiod_getservbyname
returns NULL and sets the global variable
.I errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.I hesiod_getmailhost
may fail for any of the reasons the routine
.I hesiod_resolve
may fail.
