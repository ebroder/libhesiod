.SH NAME
hesiod_getservbyname, hesiod_free_servent \- Hesiod functions for retrieving service information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <hesiod.h>
.PP
.B struct servent *hesiod_getservbyname(void *\fIcontext\fP,
.B 	const char *\fIname\fP, const char *\fIproto\fP)
.B void hesiod_free_servent(void *\fIcontext\fP, struct servent *\fIserv\fP)
.PP
.B cc file.c -lhesiod
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This family of functions allows you to retrieve service to port
mappings using Hesiod.  To perform lookups, you need an initialized
Hesiod context; see hesiod(3) for details.  Information is returned in
the same format as by
.IR getservbyname .
It is the caller's responsibility to call
.I hesiod_free_servent
with the returned service entry to free the resources used by the
service entry.
.PP
Hesiod queries for service information are made using the ``service''
Hesiod type, using the service name as the Hesiod name.  The
corresponding records should be space-separated lists of strings
giving the service name, protocol, port number (in decimal), and zero
or more aliases for the service.  There may be multiple records per
service name;
.I hesiod_getservbyname
will pick the first one whose protocol matches
.IR proto .
.SH RETURN VALUES
On failure,
.I hesiod_getservbyname
returns NULL and sets the global variable
.I errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.I hesiod_getservbyname
may fail for any of the reasons the routine
.I hesiod_resolve
may fail.
