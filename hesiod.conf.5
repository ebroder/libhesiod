.SH NAME
hesiod.conf \- Configuration file for the Hesiod library
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file hesiod.conf determines the behavior of the Hesiod library.
Blank lines and lines beginning with a `#' character are ignored.  All
other lines should be of the form
.I variable
=
.IR value ,
where the value should be a single word.  Possible variables and
values are:
.IP lhs
Specifies the domain prefix used for Hesiod queries.  In almost all
cases, you should specify ``lhs=.ns''.  The default value if you do
not specify an lhs value is no domain prefix, which is not compatible
with most Hesiod domains.
.IP rhs
Specifies the default Hesiod domain; this value may be overridden by
the
.B HES_DOMAIN
environment variable.  You must specify an rhs line for the Hesiod
library to work properly.
.IP classes
Specifies which DNS classes Hesiod should do lookups in.  Possible
values are IN (the preferred class) and HS (the deprecated class,
still used by some sites).  You may specify both classes separated by
a comma to try one class first and then the other if no entry is
available in the first class.  The default value of the classes
variable is ``IN,HS''.
.IP uidmaps
Specifies which Hesiod types to try for lookups of uid values when
.I hesiod_getpwuid
is invoked.  Possible values are ``uid'' (the preferred type) and
``passwd'' (the type historically used by Ultrix).  You may specify
both types separated by a comma to try one type first and then the
other if no entry is available using the first type.  The default
value of the uidmaps variable is ``uid''.
.SH SEE ALSO
hesiod(3)
.SH BUGS
There default value for ``lhs'' should probably be more reasonable.
